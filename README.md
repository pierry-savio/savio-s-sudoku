# Savio's Sudoku 📝

A Sudoku website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where you can create your own game from scratch, made especially for my father, Savio.

My father loves playing Sudoku. So, to practice and learn more about website creation, I decided to create this application for him. But instead of making a regular game, I suggested a challenge: creating his own game from scratch.

Although it seems easy, it's not. A Sudoku game requires following a series of rigorous steps, and if you don't follow them, the game may become invalid.
